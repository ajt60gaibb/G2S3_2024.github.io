title: Gene Golub SIAM Summer School 2024: Iterative and Randomized Methods for Large-Scale Inverse Problems
---

## Gene Golub SIAM Summer School 2024

Our Summer School will enable students to learn state-of-the-art mathematical and statistical tools to discover information hidden within large-scale data sets and solve complex inverse problems. Through hands-on experience with techniques from Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra, data assimilation, iterative algorithms, and inverse problems we will offer students a two-week summer school to learn this valuable range of computational mathematics topics. 

We look forward to welcoming you to the Gene Golub SIAM Summer School 2024 from 22 July to 2 August 2024.
